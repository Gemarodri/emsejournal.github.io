Springer Nature has institutional agreements for Open Access with universities in many countries. If you are a researcher in any of the included universities it means you can publish your EMSE article open access at no charge to yourself. You can find an overview of the agreement [here](https://www.springer.com/gp/open-access/springer-open-choice/springer-compact).
