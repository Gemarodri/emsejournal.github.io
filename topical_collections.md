# Topical Collections

Since 2020 we use topical collections in SpringerLink to collect EMSE papers that have been part of a specific special issue or theme. Topical collections span years so if we collaborate with and have a special issue with a conference over multiple years there will be multiple sets of special issue papers within the same topical collection.
