## Description of the Special Issue

This special issue in the Empirical Software Engineering journal is intended to provide practitioners and researchers with a venue to present insights, innovations, and solutions in software engineering (SE) and artificial intelligence (AI) for data quality. Modern software systems are centered on data, using data on an increasing scale and in novel and intelligent ways. Key drivers for increased data availability include the Internet of Things (IoT), data-sharing platforms, as well as open data portals. Data quality is crucial, as the data acquired and used by modern software systems strongly impacts on the reliability, robustness, efficiency, and trustworthiness of these systems.

Submitted papers must have a strong empirical basis/component to be eligible for this special issue. Empirical Software Engineering (http://link.springer.com/journal/10664) provides a forum for applied software engineering research with a strong empirical component and a venue for publishing empirical results relevant to both researchers and practitioners. In addition to the open call for papers, all authors with an accepted paper to SEA4DQ 2024 are encouraged to submit extended versions of their work. To comply with the goals of a journal publication, we are asking to revise and substantially extend original SEA4DQ 2024 papers. Some possible extensions can be adding additional practical applications determined through case studies or experiments, additional empirical validation, systematic comparisons with other approaches, or a sound theoretical foundation. Revised papers should explicitly explain how they extend the original SEA4DQ papers.

All submissions will be reviewed using the Empirical Software Engineering Journal standards and will undergo a rigorous reviewing process. Reviews of extended papers may include some of the reviewers of the SEA4DQ 2024 paper as well as some new reviewers. The guest editors of the special issue are not permitted to submit.

Submitted papers should present original, unpublished work, relevant to one of the topics of the Special Issue.  All submitted papers will be evaluated on the basis of relevance, significance of contribution, technical quality, scholarship, and quality of presentation, by at least two independent reviewers. It is the policy of the journal that no submission, or substantially overlapping submission, be published or be under review at another journal or conference at any time during the review process.
