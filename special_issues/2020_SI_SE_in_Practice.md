## Submissions

This special issue in the Empirical Software Engineering journal is intended to provide practitioners and researchers a venue to present insights, innovations, and solutions to concrete software engineering problems.  Submitted papers must have a strong empirical basis/component to be eligible for this special issue. The Empirical Software Engineering Journal (https://www.springer.com/journal/10664) provides a forum for applied software engineering research with a strong empirical component and a venue for publishing empirical results relevant to both researchers and practitioners. 

This special issue seeks both extended versions of ICSE SEIP 2021 papers and new submissions as journal first papers.

**Extended SEIP papers**: all authors of SEIP2021 research papers are invited to submit an extended version of their work. To comply with the goals of a journal publication, we are asking to revise and substantially extend original SEIP papers. We are seeking conceptual extensions in terms of new contributions and not the same content with more word or page count. Examples of possible extensions can be adding additional practical applications determined through case studies or experiments, an additional empirical validation, systematic comparisons with other approaches etc. Revised papers should explicitly explain how they extend the original SEIP paper. For extended SEIP papers, we strongly recommend authors to submit after having received and carefully considered the SEIP 2021 reviews.

**New submission**: we welcome submissions reporting industrial experiences in solving practical software engineering problems in any area. We refer to the [ICSE SEIP 2021 CfP](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2021/icse-2021-Software-Engineering-in-Practice#Call-for-Papers) (the Introduction and Full Paper sections) for further information on the scope and expectations.

All submissions will be reviewed using the Empirical Software Engineering Journal standards and will undergo a rigorous reviewing process. Reviews of extended papers may include some of the reviewers of the SEIP2021 paper as well as some new reviewers. The guest editors of the special issue are not permitted to submit.

## Schedule
- Submission Deadline:          **January 15, 2022**

Depending on the number of submissions and the number of revision rounds the papers of the special issue might be published over several EMSE issues. There may be as many revision rounds as needed for individual submissions, as Empirical Software Engineering journal values the quality of published papers over committing to special issue publication deadlines. However, decision for each submission will be made independently and papers will be published as online first articles as they are accepted for timely communication of research results.

## Submission Instructions
Papers should be submitted through the [Empirical Software Engineering editorial manager website](http://www.editorialmanager.com/emse/) (http://www.editorialmanager.com/emse/) as follows (1) select “Research Papers” and (2) later on the Additional Information page:
- Answer “Yes” to “Does this paper belong to a special issue?”
- And select “Software Engineering in Practice" for "Please select the issue your manuscript belongs to".
