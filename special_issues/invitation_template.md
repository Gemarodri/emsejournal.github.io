**Subject: <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">CONFERENCE YEAR</span>: EMSE Special Issue Invitation**
 
Dear <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">AUTHOR NAMES</span>,

We are happy to invite you to extend your <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">CONFERENCE</span> paper titled,

<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">PAPER TITLE</span>

for the Special Issue of <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">CONFERENCE</span> in the Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) journal (<https://link.springer.com/journal/10664>). We had a great set of accepted papers to select from this year but and your paper selected to be among the ones to be given the chance to extend for journal publication.

Please note that this invitation does NOT guarantee that your paper will be accepted; it gets a special "track" into the journal but will be peer reviewed as any other paper submitted to EMSE.

To be accepted your extended paper should fulfil requirements on what constitutes an extension from a conference publication to a journal one; as a starting point these rules can be based on the STVR ones in: <https://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt/stvr/26-7-October2016.html> and in: <http://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt/stvr/26-4-june2016.html>.

Be sure to also read the general information about EMSE and, in particular, the instructions for authors that you can find linked from the page: <http://www.springer.com/computer/swe/journal/10664/PSE>

It will also be very important that you follow our deadlines as outlined below:

* intention to extend: <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">December 15, 2019</span>
* submission deadline: <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">April 1, 2020</span>

We have not fixed dates for additional rounds of revisions that might be needed since our top priority is to get high-quality papers. We will give feedback on your paper as soon as reviews are in.

Note that we need you to acknowledge if you are willing to accept this invitation. Please send an email to us (guest editors of the SI) no later than <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">December 15th 2019</span>. We will then get back to you with further details about the submission process in the EMSE system. 

Thanks and we hope you will take the chance to extend your paper!

Best regards,<br/>
