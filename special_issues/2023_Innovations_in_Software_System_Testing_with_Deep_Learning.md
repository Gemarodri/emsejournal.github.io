## Description of the Special Issue
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are widely adopted in modern software systems, including safety-critical domains such as autonomous cars, medical diagnosis, and aircraft collision avoidance systems. Thus, it is crucial to rigorously test such learning-based applications to ensure high reliability and dependability. However, standard notions of software quality and reliability become irrelevant when considering learning-based systems, due to their non-deterministic nature and the lack of a transparent understanding of the models' semantics. The impact of ML and DL goes beyond simply offering new applications and case studies for testing techniques. In fact, they are revolutionizing how the software is developed and tested. Indeed, ML and DL are increasingly being applied for devising novel program analysis and software testing techniques related to malware detection, fuzzy testing, bug-finding, and type-checking.

This EMSE special issue seeks research contributions targeting the intersection of SE and ML/DL. The purpose is twofold: 
- Novel techniques to ensure the quality of learning-based applications 
- Novel techniques that use ML or DL to support software engineering tasks

The special issue invites submissions reporting new and innovative research results and industrial experience papers in the area of learning-based applications (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, transfer learning, and meta-learning) for software quality, and quality assurance techniques for learning-based applications.
