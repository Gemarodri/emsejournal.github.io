# Frequently Asked Questions

## Special Issues in Partnership with Conferences

### Q. How many SE guest editor do we need? Is there a criteria for a guest editor qualification? Should it be us or other people from PC or OC?

Typically the Program Chairs serve as guest editors. Occasionally, the General Chair is included, for example to help with papers where all the Program Chairs have conflicts. We usually ask that at least one of the guest editors has experience as an editor, ideally on EMSE. If no one from the OC has, we ask that someone from the Editorial Board is included as guest editor.

### Q. How many papers should we invite?

This is up to you but please be reasonable. Usually the distinghuished/awarded papers are good candidates for invitation. Then if other papers were close, you can invite them as well.

Feel free to run the number/list of invitees by us first before sending out invitations.

We recommend to use the [following template for invitations](/special_issues/invitation_template).

### Q. What is the general process or timeline?

This is up to you. You will need to give the author some time to prepare the paper. Once submitted, the process is the same as for regular EMSE submissions. Unlike with other journals, there is no fixed timeline for special issues at EMSE. Quality of the final set of papers is the main focus, always.

### Q. What about the deadlines?

For deadlines there are no real constraints from our perspective but typically it is good to allow at least 5-7 months after the event itself to allow time for extensions. Do not state a date for first notifications since this can be hard to guarantee anyway. Overall the focus is quality rather than keeping to a particular timeline. Since papers will be accepted and published online as they "come in" and you don't need to wait for them all to be finished and publish them in a batch this also gives more flexibility of timeline. So your main constraint in selecting a deadline should probably be to align with other major deadlines of the community, i.e. try to avoid the same week as one of the major conferences etc.

### Q. Can we extend the deadline (when it is approaching) if this is requested by (multiple) authors?

Yes, this is up to you and an extension of 1-2 weeks is not uncommon. If you do make sure to email all authors about it so that the situation is the same/fair for everyone.

### Q. How to judge what is enough of an extension to a previously published (conference) paper?

The general answer is that every accepted paper should have a significant extension. It is hard to specify exactly what is enough of an extension but typically we want to see both more/different data, more/additional research questions/hypotheses being tested, and a deeper/refined analysis. Ideally, we want to avoid papers that only add data but has essentially the same results so it is often good to hint at this when inviting authors. For copyright reasons we also want to avoid that authors include long passages of their original paper copied verbatim; even if this may not be plagiarism as typically defined it can become a problem in Springer's automated checks and filters. If this happens for background and related work sections it is less of a concern than if it happens in result and/or discussion sections. We also require extended papers to be clear and upfront with the fact that they are extensions (so the extended paper **must** be cited in the extension) and to explicitly make clear what the extensions are (typically towards the end of the introduction section).

If you want to give some background information to authors when inviting them or if someone asks you it might be good to also point them to the STVR editorials that discuss this:

> "To be accepted your extended paper should fulfil requirements on what constitutes an extension from a conference publication to a journal one; as a starting point these rules can be based on the STVR ones in: <https://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt/stvr/26-7-October2016.html> and in: <http://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt/stvr/26-4-june2016.html> As discussed in these links, it is hard to specify exactly what is enough of an extension but typically we want to see both more/different data, more/additional research questions/hypotheses being tested, and a deeper/refined analysis."

### Q. Will we need to write an editorial/introduction to the Special Issue?

Yes, this is customary and often not very time consuming. You can find examples on Springer Link. Note that since the autumn of 2020 papers that are accepted to EMSE are published (online) continuously as they are finalized. This means that we will not "hold" papers for your SI until a decision on the "last" one has been taken. Thus, it makes sense that you write a short introduction with a brief paragraph per paper as a kind of "placeholder" and overview of your special issue.
