## Editors of the Special Issue

* Mei Nagappan, U.Waterloo,  mei.nagappan (at) uwaterloo.ca

## Scope

We ask authors to comment on the success and failings of software analytics over the last 20 years and will ask "what and how can we do it better in future?". It is encouraged, but not mandatory that authors explore the ethical issues raised in many places (including, but not limited to, https://github.com/txt/se20/blob/master/docs/l06ethics.md).

We will accept technical papers: discussing how  AI tools have been applied to SE such as predictive modeling and other AI methods. Both positive and negative results are welcome, though negative results should still be based on rigorous research and provide details on lessons learned. We will also accept shorter industrial papers: (at least 4 pages)  describing results, challenges, lessons learned from industrial applications of software analytics .
