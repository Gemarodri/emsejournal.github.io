# Registered Reports

The EMSE journal has worked with conferences to provide registered reports since 2019. You can read more about the initiative [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03649). The first stage is done as a track at a conference. If a paper gets an in principle acceptance, the authors then conduct the study based on the first stage protocol, write a paper reporting on it, and submits it to the EMSE journal for review.

The following conferences is working or have worked with us on registered reports.
