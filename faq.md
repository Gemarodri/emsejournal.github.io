### Q. Is there an EMSE template on Overleaf?

Yes, there is a general template file for Springer's SVJour3 Latex that you can start from. You can find it here: [Overleaf SVJour3 General Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/a-general-template-file-for-the-latex-package-svjour3-for-springer-journals/pbbwqhxxvtbp). For detailed submission instructions be sure to always go to the [official EMSE submission instruction page](https://www.springer.com/journal/10664/submission-guidelines); while the Overleaf template might not be up-to-date the one linked from our Springer site always will.
