# Frequently Asked Questions

## Submissions

### Q. Is there an EMSE template on Overleaf?

Yes, there is a general template file for Springer's SVJour3 Latex that you can start from. You can find it here: [Overleaf SVJour3 General Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/a-general-template-file-for-the-latex-package-svjour3-for-springer-journals/pbbwqhxxvtbp). For detailed submission instructions be sure to always go to the [official EMSE submission instruction page](https://www.springer.com/journal/10664/submission-guidelines); while the Overleaf template might not be up-to-date the one linked from our Springer site always will be.

### Q. Does EMSE have a definition of Conflict of Interest (CoI) that I should consider if proposing reviewers for my paper?

Our submission guidelines have detailed information about this: [Conflicts of Interest / Competing Interests](https://www.springer.com/journal/10664/submission-guidelines#Instruction%20for%20Authors_Conflicts%20of%20Interest%20/%20Competing%20Interests)
but is more focused on the actual work/submission rather than for proposing reviewers etc. General Springer guidelines is more applicable for proposing reviewers (scroll to bottom of page): [Ethical responsibilities of authors](https://www.springer.com/gp/editorial-policies/ethical-responsibilities-of-authors)
We think that the ACM Conflict of Interest policy is a good one that should be considered, in general, in the SE community: [Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest)

### Q: Does EMSE accept and publish secondary studies such as systematic literature reviews (SLRs) or systematic mapping (sysmap) studies?

While EMSE does occasionally publish secondary studies like systematic reviews, the bar is set high. A traditional review that merely summarizes the state of the art or highlights trends is usually not sufficient. We expect a deeper analysis, often involving the synthesis of information into a model, framework, or other form that offers meaningful new insights to the research community.

Moreover, if similar SLRs or sysmap studies have already been conducted, the rationale for a new one must be compelling. Authors need to clearly explain what added value their study brings compared to existing work. Simply providing an updated review without contributing substantial new insights won’t meet our standards.

Overall, these requirements can be challenging to meet, and in many cases, other venues may be more suitable for such studies. However, we do not categorically exclude them—if your work truly offers fresh perspectives and significant value, we are open to considering it.
