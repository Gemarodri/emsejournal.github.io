# Frequently Asked Questions

## Submissions

### Q. Is there an EMSE template on Overleaf?

Yes, there is a general template file for Springer's SVJour3 Latex that you can start from. You can find it here: [Overleaf SVJour3 General Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/a-general-template-file-for-the-latex-package-svjour3-for-springer-journals/pbbwqhxxvtbp). For detailed submission instructions be sure to always go to the [official EMSE submission instruction page](https://www.springer.com/journal/10664/submission-guidelines); while the Overleaf template might not be up-to-date the one linked from our Springer site always will be.

### Q. Does EMSE have a definition of Conflict of Interest (CoI) that I should consider if proposing reviewers for my paper?

Our submission guidelines have detailed information about this: [Conflicts of Interest / Competing Interests](https://www.springer.com/journal/10664/submission-guidelines#Instruction%20for%20Authors_Conflicts%20of%20Interest%20/%20Competing%20Interests)
but is more focused on the actual work/submission rather than for proposing reviewers etc. General Springer guidelines is more applicable for proposing reviewers (scroll to bottom of page): [Ethical responsibilities of authors](https://www.springer.com/gp/editorial-policies/ethical-responsibilities-of-authors)
We think that the ACM Conflict of Interest policy is a good one that should be considered, in general, in the SE community: [Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest)
