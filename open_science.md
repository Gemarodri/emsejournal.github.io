### Open Science Initiative

We encourage open science. Since May 2019 we have two Open Science chairs on our board. They lead our Open Science Review Board. Once your paper is accepted they will review your open data, materials and/or replication package and (optionally) assign a badge to indicate that your paper is open. 

We have [published an editorial explaining our reasoning](https://rdcu.be/bzZzL). You can also find detailed information about our [Open Science Initiative on GitHub](https://github.com/emsejournal/openscience). You can find a [list of the papers that have been awarded the Open Science](open_science_papers).

How to best use Open Science in Software Engineering is still something that we need to discuss as a community. We will evolve our initiative in the coming years to better support the community. We invite you to take part in this discussion by joining [this mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-science-software-engineering).
